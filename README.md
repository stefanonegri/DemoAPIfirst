# Demo API first integration
## Intro
The demo aims to cover the 2 possible approach for API first integration: 1) bottom up and 2) top down
### Bottom up
This case is suitable when a company has a set of digital assets that he wants to make available as managed APIs; it includes 2 steps:
1. The first step transforms the asset (a database table in this sample) in an REST API
2. The second step makes the REST API available to internal and external users as managed API
